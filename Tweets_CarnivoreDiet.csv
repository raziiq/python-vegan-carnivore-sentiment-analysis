1,"@awright4645 @saladeaufromage I'm not promoting it on that basis, I'm saying that a few people choose it to improve their health. Fewer people (in this theoretical scenario where everyone did go onto a carnivore diet) would be inevitable. That doesn't mean it's the intention of the diet."

4,@awright4645 @saladeaufromage You've said yourself that fewer people could be fed on a carnivore diet - a transition to carnivore would therefore reduce more than just food emissions. One of the major drivers of population has been our ability to produce masses of cheap calories.

6,"@saladeaufromage I don't know why you're being obtuse. It's not about whether the world will shift to carnivore diets. The point is that the small minority of animal products in the human diet are responsible for the majority of its harmful impacts, (e.g. habitat loss, water pollution, etc). So"
7,@ItsFearItSelf Meat has everything the human body needs and nothing it doesn't. The carnivore diet is way healthier.
8,"@saladeaufromage The point is that there's no reason to think a carnivore diet would kill fewer animals, considering that our 18% of animal-derived calories are responsible for 83% of the habitat that's cleared for agriculture and protected from pests, as well as 56-58% of water/air pollution"
9,"@UrsaAnders ""As long as it's meat, I'll eat it."" Though, he did have favorites, like most; just that he won't turn it down. That's just the way it was with being majority carnivore. Anything goes.

11,"Dr honeydip says (correctly, I believe) that sugar does not cause insulin resistance by itself

That's fine

Most people looking at something as ridiculous as a carnivore diet, however, are doing so because they are already insulin resistant."
12,@saladeaufromage It doesn't need to happen for us to see the comparative costs of animal vs plant foods. Animal foods represent a minority of the human food supply yet the vast majority of its environmental impacts. There is zero reason to think a carnivore diet is less harmful or more ethical
