So yes. The diet is also included."
1,"@JasonVivier7 @SticksAndBr1cks I don't really attempt to manage anything, im vegan for animals first, i don't concentrate on much but in saying that i eat a varied diet from most groups though i could eat more leafy greens. B12 from nutritional yeast and fortified milks.This should help https://t.co/P8EX2uH0wL"
2,"@keanadianne Because veganism includes the diet, it's a lifestyle that also includes a diet. You cannot do one half and then eat meat and call yourself vegan. 
I think the issue is you're trying to change the definition of the vegan society to suit. Read Donald Watsons writings."
3,please tell me how you’re on a vegan diet and eating dairy whip cream
4,"@keanadianne Incorrect. 
The word Vegan was coined by the vegan society under Donald Watson. 
The society was setup as an animal liberation group but also included the term coined for people who abstain from all animal exploitation including diet."
5,"@keanadianne I gave you a simple example regarding a vegetarian eating meat and you said they are not vegetarian. 

It's the same thing with Veganism. If you eat meat or dairy you are not vegan. 

Sure you may be eating a mostly plant based diet, but it doesnt make you vegan."
6,"@keanadianne Because if you eat aninal products you are paying for the death of animals. If you cannot thrive or survive on a vegan diet, dont try it. If you cant do it you cannot just call yourself vegan anyway."

8,"@Ambirdy123 I hate to be that vegan but you're plant-based, that's why you and vegans don't see eye to eye on this. It's not about diet for us, it's about the animals. You don't want to eat any animal products when you're vegan, and definitely don't encourage others to do it."
9,"@Theknowlestweet You aren’t really answering my questions. Why is a person who can’t eat a plant based diet, but still lives in a way that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, exploitation of and cruelty to animals not vegan? Why does someone have to be plant based to be vegan?"
10,"@keanadianne Well the definition of the vegan society covers that by using the phrase ""wherever practicable"" 
But if you cannot survive on a vegan diet you shouldnt even try to."
11,@Bee_Zelda Vegan 4 years. Adding more crops &amp;  efficient/environmentally friendly sources to my diet as frequently as possible.

13,"@ukmav @SticksAndBr1cks How does it degrade it? It strengthens it. Some humans don’t care about animals at all, but being vegan/reducing meat &amp; animal byproduct in our diet is beneficial to humans too. It’s a great argument for convincing people to be vegan.

16,"@mckinlay_liz Well done Liz, you can still have pasta, bread and rice but make sure it’s brown that way you get the goodness of the fibre, I lost 3 stone in 3 months when I first went vegan when I gave up white food and animal products, hardly put any of it back &amp; my diet is all carbs now 😊"
17,@hatttiegladwell Im also allergic to soy so makes things harder when it comes to vegan products but vegetarian yes. She sounds ableist and classist some people truly can't afford to stick to a vegan diet. Dairy alternatives are expensive as shit lmao
18,@hatttiegladwell Thing is I could go vegan but that doesn't mean I could 100% stick to a vegan diet 24/7 (vegetarian I could) it is v hard when you have half your digestive system missing. Obviously people can make changes but to say no health issue stops you being vegan is ableist as fuck lmao
