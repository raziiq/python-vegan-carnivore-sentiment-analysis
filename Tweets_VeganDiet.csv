So yes. The diet is also included."

B12 from nutritional yeast and fortified milks.This should help https://t.co/P8EX2uH0wL"
2,"@keanadianne Because veganism includes the diet, it's a lifestyle that also includes a diet. You cannot do one half and then eat meat and call yourself vegan. 
I think the issue is you're trying to change the definition of the vegan society to suit. Read Donald Watsons writings."
3,please tell me how you‚Äôre on a vegan diet and eating dairy whip cream
4,"@keanadianne Incorrect. 
The word Vegan was coined by the vegan society under Donald Watson. 
The society was setup as an animal liberation group but also included the term coined for people who abstain from all animal exploitation including diet."
5,"@keanadianne I gave you a simple example regarding a vegetarian eating meat and you said they are not vegetarian. 

It's the same thing with Veganism. If you eat meat or dairy you are not vegan. 

Sure you may be eating a mostly plant based diet, but it doesnt make you vegan."

9,"@Theknowlestweet You aren‚Äôt really answering my questions. Why is a person who can‚Äôt eat a plant based diet, but still lives in a way that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, exploitation of and cruelty to animals not vegan? Why does someone have to be plant based to be vegan?"

13,"@ukmav @SticksAndBr1cks How does it degrade it? It strengthens it. Some humans don‚Äôt care about animals at all, but being vegan/reducing meat &amp; animal byproduct in our diet is beneficial to humans too. It‚Äôs a great argument for convincing people to be vegan.

18,@hatttiegladwell Thing is I could go vegan but that doesn't mean I could 100% stick to a vegan diet 24/7 (vegetarian I could) it is v hard when you have half your digestive system missing. Obviously people can make changes but to say no health issue stops you being vegan is ableist as fuck lmao

494,@MxBadgerNorth This opinion is weak. I have crohns disease which can be triggered by starches/carbs. Beans/pulses/lentils/legumes sadly make me sick. Which I believe is a large portion of a vegan diet. Veganism would make me sick.
495,Pure vegan diet https://t.co/F9dLoFQLtB
496,@aubrey_huff You feel good initially because plant based foods are cleansing foods. But after a while your body will need nourishing nutrient dense foods as well. Hard to sustain a vegan diet properly and get adequate long term nutrition.
497,@ItsFearItSelf Only commented because I watched gamechangers 2 times as well and it made me make some changes but opened my eyes to some other things like salt and common vegan diet mistakes.
498,"@Lolaliness the diet excuse sounds great actually, thank you!!! i'll use it 
also, i'll try going for more salads!!!! i already stopped almost all my dairy consumption (i just need to find a place to get vegan cheese easier) but i relied on eggs way too much as a vegetarian, i have to stop"
499,also not everyone is privileged enough to afford a vegan diet because veganism is expensive.
